#Topic Request
This repo is created so you can request specific topic, question, technology or feature via opening issue.
When issue is created I'll make research to find more information about requested information, group it up and prepare it in the way I can share it with you.

#How to ask
Create your request by opening [new issue](https://github.com/Artinov/topic-request/issues/new) in this repository.  
**Use english language** to put together your questions and thoughts.  
Shortly descript your question in issue title.  
Feel free to write as much information as you want in issue commentary section.  
It'll be nice if you give me some links (if there any) so I can clearly see what you want to hear from me.
